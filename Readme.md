Our project CURA CORDIS ( PERSONALIZED HEART CARE SYSTEM)
has been done as a part of our minor project for the Bachelor of technology at
Jaypee institute of Information and Technology. We started our Project at the
beginning of month January and we had around four months to fulfill this task and
we have to submit this Project at the end of the month April . We used to have
regular meetings with our mentor regarding the progress of our project.
Being highly interested in technology specially related to Machine Learning, this
project was a great opportunity for us to enhance our technical skills in terms of
practical knowledge , also it give us the time to analyse ourself and confirm our
field of interest. With the help of Machine learning we can make estimations ,predictions and also this technology gives the ability to machine to learn by
themselves. Today machine learning plays a vital role in various fields such as
Finance, Medicine, Defence etc. This is the reason I decided to conduct my project
around the Machine Learning and Data analytics.
